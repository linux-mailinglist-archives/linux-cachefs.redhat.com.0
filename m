David,

First off, thanks so much for all the hard work you've put in on fscache
over the years. We have been happily using fscache/cachefiles a lot in the
last couple of years (you may have seen my "Adventures in re-exporting"
thread). So I'm really looking forward to trying out the new version with
our demanding and unique workloads.

One standout limitation though is the 1GB cache file size mentioned in the
future work section. We have lots of >1G files currently being cached by
fscache with our workloads and so we may be stuck on the old version (and
kernels) until that is worked on more. But it doesn't stop us from taking
part in some early testing.

I'm also wondering if the cachefilesd userspace daemon will be getting an
update to go with this? I only ask because we have been having problems
with culling stopping randomly and I was hoping that this new iter version
might help resolve that issue. Then again, it could be the interaction with
the cachefiles module that is the underlying issue.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to testing this out with Dave Wysochanski's NFS
implementation.

Many thanks,

Daire
